This is what I currently envision I could be doing in the coming years, specifically, in the fields of computer science. Honestly, I've only taken (not including this semester) 2 CS subject related courses, thus some of this might be inaccurate or naive.
I am primarily interested in the fields of human-computer interaction, machine learning and by extension artificial intelligence, and computer graphics.

Human-computer interaction is interesting due to how prevalent it has become in recent years. Nearly everyone in a more developed country possesses some form of computer be it a smart phone or otherwise. Thus, the applications of human-computer interaction grow more apparent. I envision possibly working with smart devices to create an application which utilizes the unique aspects of a handheld smart phone, such as its mobility, rear-facing and front-facing camera, GPS capability, and audio recording capability among other things.

Artificial intelligence and its subset machine learning are other fields I might focus on. Like human-computer interaction, AI and machine learning has become more prevalent, especially with recent trends in virtual assistants like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Google Assistant, or Microsoft's Cortana. Consequently, the technological applications for a focus on AI and machine learning grow as virtual assistants proliferate. It's often hypothesized that people working in computer science or related disciplines will eventually put themselves out of a job when AI becomes advanced enought to program itself.
