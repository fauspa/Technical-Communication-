This is what I currently envision I could be doing in the coming years, specifically, in the fields of computer science. Honestly, I've only taken (not including this semester) 2 computer science subject related courses, thus some of this might be inaccurate or naive.
I am primarily interested in the fields of human-computer interaction, machine learning and by extension artificial intelligence, and computer graphics.

Human-computer interaction is interesting due to how prevalent it has become in recent years. Nearly everyone in a more developed country possesses some form of computer be it a smart phone or otherwise. Thus, the applications of human-computer interaction grow more apparent. I envision possibly working with smart devices to create an application which utilizes the unique aspects of a handheld smart phone, such as its mobility, rear-facing and front-facing camera, GPS capability, and audio recording capability among other things.

Artificial intelligence and its subset machine learning are other fields I might focus on. Like human-computer interaction, AI and machine learning has become more prevalent, especially with recent trends in virtual assistants like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Google Assistant, or Microsoft's Cortana. Consequently, the technological applications for a focus on AI and machine learning grow as virtual assistants proliferate. With the increase in virtual assistants in homes, it is likely that many houses may choose to integrate them in its infrastructure (smart homes, for instance). In other applications, AI and machine learning could provide increased automation of work, such as the resume screening process.

Computer graphics is an interesting branch of computer science in that its results are often visually apparent. It's applications are found in a variety of mediums. Many animated films utilize computer graphics to present a story. Likewise, most videogames today primarily use computer graphics as well. Thus, considering my interest in these mediums, I can envision myself having a focus on computer graphics. Outside of such mediums computer graphics could be used to create simulations or representations of reality.
